# Contribution to `github-stats`

This document contains the working agreements of the team for a consistent
development across the team.

## Branching

Since we use semantic commits for development, the same approach can be used for
branches. Therefore, branch names will follow this structure:

```
<type>/<meaningful-description>

# feat/add-x-entity
# docs/team-ceremonies
```

## Commits

We use semantic commits for a better understanding of what is committed. This
also helps us understand the type of changes that are being made and allows us a
cleaner git history when looking back.

See this [link](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
for more information

## Pull requests

Ideally we should have one branch per ticket/issue. In case the ticket is to
big, consider splitting in smaller tickets to prevent having huge PRs which will
take a lot of time for each member.

Make sure to use the PR template that is configured so that all the team is in
consonancy. There are instructions in th template on how to properly fill the
fields of the PR. 

## Meetings

We have accorded to have a weekly meeting around 16:00 on weekends to discuss
progress, problems and similar. If you are not available, send a message through
the group chat so that another day can be found (or to skip the meeting if
there's nothing relevant).

## Project solution/documentation

All the documentation will be stored in the bookstack application.
